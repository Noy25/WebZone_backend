when connected user presses the "Work Together" link, it should :

1. Store his active wap in the database with a FRONTEND-GENERATED id.

2. That same wap id should be copied to the link he will be sending to his peers like so : localhost:3000/editor/wapId ( = 'lk52jlkfdj0q139rjasdf).

3. Emit a socket event to the backend to create a room with that same wapId.

4. The user that connects to our app via shared link should JOIN that same room on CONNECTION.

5. The connected user should then load the wap from our DB via query params.
